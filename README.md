# RxJS Form Validators & Filtering!

This repository was created to help further my understanding of RxJS!

I wanted to see if I could combine a stream of data coming from a server and filter it based on the inputs of form elements. While also providing some crud form validation. I couldn't find any examples of this so I decided to make my own! Hopefully this code base will be useful to somebody.

> Note: I didn't use any modern JS frameworks for updating the DOM. The ideas here should be able to translate over to any modern JS framework, especially Angular.

The dependencies are just `rxjs` and `date-fns`.

## Getting Started

    $ yarn install
    $ yarn start

This should install everything needed and also serve the `transaction.json` file that the javascript code will fetch.

## Plans

- Update code to be more readable
- Add better design
- Add more features and examples of using RxJS
- Add more documentation
- Add unit tests
